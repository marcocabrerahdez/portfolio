# How I Built an RAG Pipeline with Transformers

Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (RAG) using Hugging Face and FAISS was one of the most practical applications of LLMs in my recent work.

## ðŸ§  Why RAG?

The main challenge was building a scalable question-answering system over a large set of unstructured legal documents. Traditional keyword-based search systems failed to capture semantic relevance, so we turned to RAG.

## ðŸ”§ Stack

- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- FAISS
- Langchain
- PostgreSQL

## ðŸš€ Outcome

We achieved **93% accuracy** on legal compliance doc classification and significantly reduced document retrieval latency thanks to FAISS indexing and chunked embedding strategies.
